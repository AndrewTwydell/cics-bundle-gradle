The 1.0.1 versions of the standalone project archives here were created by bumping the versions of those projects in the test resources folder (e.g. cics-bundle-gradle\src\test\resources\standalone-war\build.gradle), running the full Gradle build, copying the built archives from the build output folder (e.g. cics-bundle-gradle\build\test-projects\Test standalone war project\standalone-war\build\libs\standalone-war-1.0.1.war), and then changing the versions back to 1.0.0.
